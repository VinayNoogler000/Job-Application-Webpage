# Job Application Webpage

**_I had developed a basic Job Application Webpage, as a practice projet, by just using HTML & CSS technologies._** 

**_I had utilized CSS Grid, Flexbox and Media Queries to make the webpage responsive, according to the viewport's width, and to better the user experience._**

_Hope you liked it! Please, feel free to give me constructive feedbacks._
